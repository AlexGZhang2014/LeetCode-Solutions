# LeetCode-Solutions
Ah yes, the dreaded LeetCode. I have finally begun to do these problems. Why, you may ask? Because:

1) I want to keep my problem-solving skills sharp.
2) I want to practice coding in Java instead of JavaScript.
3) I want to reinforce my ever-expanding knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
4) I want to land a much better, much higher-paying software developer job eventually. And unfortunately, this is one of the only ways to get past the interview(s).

So yeah, I'll try to do one LeetCode problem every day. If I can't because of work/life obligations, then that's okay too.
